## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or navigate to the project directory):
   ```bash
   cd "Email Spam Detector"
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data** (required for text processing):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## 📦 Dependencies

- `streamlit==1.30.0` - Web application framework
- `nltk==3.9.1` - Natural Language Processing library
- `pandas==2.1.0` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `scikit-learn==1.3.0` - Machine learning library

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`)

3. **Enter a message** in the text area and click "Predict" to classify it as spam or not spam

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Text Preprocessing
The application preprocesses input text through the following steps:
- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words
- **Special Character Removal**: Removes non-alphanumeric characters
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminates common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and")
- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form using Porter Stemmer

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts preprocessed text into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency

### 3. Classification
- **Naive Bayes Model**: The trained model predicts whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0)

## 📊 Model Development

The project includes Jupyter notebooks for the complete machine learning pipeline:

- **`EDA_and_Experiments.ipynb`**: Exploratory data analysis and experiments
- **`preprocessing.ipynb`**: Data cleaning and text transformation pipeline
- **`Model_Building.ipynb`**: Model training, evaluation, and selection

### Model Training Process:
1. Load and clean the raw dataset
2. Preprocess text data (lowercase, tokenize, remove stop words, stem)
3. Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
4. Vectorize text using TF-IDF
5. Train Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB)
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Save trained model and vectorizer for deployment

## 📝 Notes

- The pre-trained models (`model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`) must be present in the `Models/` directory for the application to work
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the application
- The model was trained on a specific dataset; performance may vary with different message styles or languages
